# Phase 3: Application Layer - Advanced Use Cases and Competition System

## 🎯 Goal

Implement advanced application layer use cases for competition management, performance analysis, content generation, and advanced keyboard layout features.

## 📋 Tasks

### Competition Management (`src/application/use-cases/competition/`)

- [ ] `create-competition.ts` - Set up daily/weekly typing challenges
- [ ] `join-competition.ts` - User registration for competitions
- [ ] `submit-competition-entry.ts` - Submit competitive typing results
- [ ] `get-competition-leaderboard.ts` - Rankings for competitions
- [ ] Implement standardized layouts and fair competition rules

### Content Generation (`src/application/use-cases/content/`)

- [ ] `generate-typing-content.ts` - Smart content generation by language/layout
- [ ] `adapt-difficulty.ts` - Dynamic difficulty based on user performance
- [ ] `recommend-practice.ts` - Personalized practice recommendations
- [ ] Multi-language content with cultural context

### Advanced Layout Features (`src/application/use-cases/keyboard-layouts/`)

- [ ] `create-custom-layout.ts` - Advanced custom layout creation
- [ ] `export-import-layout.ts` - Layout sharing between users
