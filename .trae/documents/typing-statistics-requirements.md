## 1. Product Overview
Typing Statistics Enhancement for Typoria - A comprehensive performance tracking system that records and analyzes user typing performance over time using local storage for data persistence.

The enhancement adds detailed statistics tracking to help users monitor their typing improvement, identify patterns, and set performance goals. All data is stored locally in the browser for privacy and offline access.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 User Roles
No specific user roles required - the statistics system works for both authenticated and anonymous users, with data stored locally per browser session.

### 2.2 Feature Module
Our typing statistics enhancement consists of the following main components:
1. **Statistics Dashboard**: comprehensive performance overview, historical data visualization, improvement trends.
2. **Real-time Performance Display**: live WPM tracking, accuracy calculation, session statistics.
3. **Data Persistence Layer**: local storage management, user-specific data isolation, data export capabilities.
4. **View Toggle Interface**: seamless switching between typing test and statistics views.

## 3. Core Process

**Main User Flow:**
Users start on the typing test interface where they can see real-time performance metrics. When a test completes, results are automatically saved to local storage. Users can switch to the statistics dashboard to view comprehensive performance analytics, track improvement over time, and manage their data.

**Statistics Tracking Flow:**
Each completed typing test generates a detailed result record including WPM, accuracy, test duration, language, character count, and error count. This data is stored locally and used to calculate aggregate statistics and improvement trends.
